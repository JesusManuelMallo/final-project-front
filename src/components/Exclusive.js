            <h2>Unreleased Music</h2>
            <h3>Jesus Mallo has composed and recorded more than 100 songs. Some has been lost forever due to loss of data after various
            computer crashes since 2002. However he keeps in his 'vault' (in Google Drive, and an external HDD) a lot of unreleased songs, or rarities like "I KNOW", recorded in his
            home studio, playing acoustic guitar and singing. The last verse in the song, "This isn´t the last song" is taken from Björk´s 'Dancing in the darkness' film
            OST, a film where she is also the main character. Jesus Mallo dedicated "I Know" song, recorded in 2015, to his best friend and to his physician, during stressful moments filled with uncertainty in personal issues.<br/>

among a wide spectrum of other musicians from different genres.           <b>But... Wich are Jesus Mallo's favourite songs? Below you have some the songs he most uses to listen to. Of course, songs from...</b></h3>

       <br/><hr/>
        <h2>Favourite Album</h2>
            <h3>With no doubt, Jesus Mallo's favourite album and main influence is "The Beautiful Experience" by Prince, an album that was published by Prince own record company, during his battle to get away from Warner Music, so is not very known despite being a masterpiece.
            <br/>Prince played all instruments for this album. This album is considered by Jesus Mallo as a musical 'delicatessen'</h3>

        <h2>Minerals</h2>
            <h3>One of the various things Jesus Mallo likes to collect, are minerals. Near where he lives, there's a small area in a place he knows in "Montseny Natural Park", where he enjoys going to pick minerals like amethyst, fluoriet and quarz. There's a lot in there"
            <br/>He also likes to collect fossils from the eocene period (40M years ago), that can also be found near where he lives. As this site will be updated periodically, check later for pictures of his minerals and fossils collection.</h3>

            <h2>Dalí</h2>     
            <h3>Salvador Dalí is a very important person for Jesus Mallo, not only his paintings, nor the way he acted eccentrically, but the brilliantness of the ideas he transmitted during his interviews.</h3>
